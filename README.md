## Setup and Installation

Before setting up the project, ensure that Python and SQL Server are installed on your system. The application utilizes Windows Authentication to connect to the SQL Server, thus it should be configured to allow trusted connections. For development purposes, the connection settings are specified in the db.py file. Modify the connection string to match your SQL Server configuration. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management tool for handling sensitive information in production environments.

## Database Connection Management

The application establishes a new database connection for each transaction. In a production environment, consider implementing connection pooling to optimize performance and resource utilization. Always ensure that connections are properly closed after transactions to prevent resource leaks.

## Scalability and Security

Scalability: To enhance scalability, consider using a load balancer and deploying the application in a distributed environment.
Security: Implement input validation to prevent SQL injection and other common security vulnerabilities. Regularly update the application and its dependencies to mitigate security risks.
